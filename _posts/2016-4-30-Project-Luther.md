title: Metis Project Luther - Bookz II Moviez

I just finished my second data science project at Metis. Project Luther was slightly more broad in direction than my first, with the only guidelines being that the project had to be about movies, the data had to be scraped from the internet, and that linear regression was required in analyzing the data. I suppose another requirement would be that there had to be some sort of marketability to the project, as we were supposed to pitch our analysis in a business format.

I'm not a huge movie buff, but a recent hobby I've picked up again in the past few years is reading. I'm a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi novels. A favorite of mine is the Kingkiller Chronicle series by Patrick Rothfuss, which Lionsgate studios recently picked up to be made into a film. I began thinking about many of my favorite novels that have yet to be adapted to the silver screen and came upon the overarching question I seeked to answer: What are the characteristics of books that lead them to be successful in their movie adaptations? Is it a certain genre? An intended audience? How much text is required in order to be sufficiently fleshed out? There were tons of questions one could seek to answer in this line of thinking, but I quickly choose to hone in on something relatively simple, given that I only had two weeks for my project.

To be continued...
